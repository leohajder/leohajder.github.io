My personal website, includes a short CV, development and music portfolios and social media links. Visit [leohajder.github.io](https://leohajder.github.io/).

## How to create your own?

Put the contents of your site in a new rpository named `<your_username>.github.io` and push. You can create a page for any repository, using the `master` branch or the `/docs` folder inside it. For more info see [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/).
